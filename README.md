## Requirements

* Implement a command line interface that lets the humans play the game by typing commands into the terminal.
* Players should be able to input their moves.

* The game should announce the result of the game when it's over

## Rules

* There are two players in the game (X and O)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A turn ends when a player claims a field
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins
* A game is over when all fields are taken
